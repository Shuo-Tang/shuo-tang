## Direct Position Estimation 
Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a high-sensitivity receiver design, particularly effective in GNSS applications. Unlike traditional methods, the DPE algorithm solves for PVT directly from raw satellite signals, withou estimating intermediate quantities, e.g. pseudorange and carrier phase.  
Our initial and "naive" idea is that traditional positioning techniques developed over past decades can also enhance the existing DPE approach.

  text="DPE itself has the nature of mitigating the effect of multipath by fusing the information of each satellite at an earlier stage. We demonstartes this ability by plotting multipath error evenlope and simulating in LMSCM (Land Mobile Satellite Channel Model) from DLR (German Aerospace Center)."

## Physics-informed learning
Augmented physics-based model (APBM) is a hybrid physics-based data-driven model, which is capable of learning complex state dynamics while maintaining some level of model interpretability by keeping the physics knowledge.

  title="APBM"
  text="We consider APBM as a physics-based model plus a nerual network, e.g. Multilayer perceptron. Due to the nonlinearity of the model, the Cubature Kalman filter is usually implemented to performing the state estimate and learning process. Besides, we extend the APBM to the high-order Markovity and noise identification problems."

## Cognitive Radar
Cognitive radars refer to the radars that can adaptively change its parameters, e.g. the location of the radar, the waveform, and power of the transmitting signals, to achieve better tracking performance in a closed loop through optimization principles. 
This capability of responding to the dynamic target through waveform agility also enables the detection of the cognitive behavior of the radar from the target side.
